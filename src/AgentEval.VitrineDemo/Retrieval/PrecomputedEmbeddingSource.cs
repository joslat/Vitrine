/// <para>
/// <b>Resolution order:</b> committed product vector → live embedding (when one was supplied) →
/// unavailable, which the retriever turns into LOUD degraded mode. There is no fourth step, and
/// specifically no hash-embedder fallback: a signed-FNV bag-of-words vector would demonstrate
/// plumbing while quietly breaking the one claim the demo exists to make.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>This is an index with a live query path, not a query lookup table.</b> The committed asset
/// contains product documents only; open-ended query text is embedded when searched. A measured
/// smoke check against the shipped index returns Sony α7 IV for <c>"camera"</c> at 0.372 and the
/// Arc'teryx shell for <c>"a warm jacket for hiking"</c> at 0.458. Nadia's composed label
/// <c>"multi-day trips, starts before sunrise, carried"</c> retrieves the Osprey pack (0.381),
/// Peak Design tripod (0.365), Katadyn filter (0.327), and Petzl headlamp (0.325).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A product vector is a reusable description of a catalogue item. A pre-guessed query vector is
/// an incomplete answer to a question not yet asked, so query vectors are never committed.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The stamp is checked, not trusted.</b> Model, dimensions and
/// <see cref="EmbeddingDocument.TemplateVersion"/> must all match. If
/// <see cref="EmbeddingDocument.ForProduct"/> ever changes, the committed vectors describe text
/// that no longer exists — and retrieving against them would silently return plausible, wrong
/// neighbours. <see cref="Load"/> throws on a mismatch. <see cref="TryLoad"/> converts the throw
/// into a warning the caller must print, and returns an EMPTY source so the run degrades loudly
/// instead of retrieving against stale vectors. A live source whose model id differs from the
/// asset's stamp is refused the same way: a cache hit and a cache miss answered from two different
/// embedding spaces is worse than no cache at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Within one run, one text is embedded once.</b> The live path is memoised per instance
/// (<see cref="LiveMemoHits"/> against <see cref="FallbackCalls"/>), keyed on the exact text, and
/// the memo entry is the in-flight TASK rather than its result — so two concurrent searches for
/// the same need issue one call, not two. The memo is deliberately separate from the committed
/// dictionary, so <see cref="CachedVectorCount"/> keeps describing the ASSET and never quietly
/// grows to include things this process happened to look up.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>"Once" means once per byte-identical query text.</b> The committed lookup keys on
/// <see cref="EmbeddingDocument.HashQuery"/>, which trims,
/// lower-cases and collapses whitespace; the memo keys on the exact ordinal string. So two texts
/// that share a committed-lookup key can still be embedded twice. A measured query and its
/// upper-cased form cost two live calls and came back
/// at cosine <b>0.856</b> to each other — a real difference in the answer, not just in the bill.
/// Exact memo keys ensure no query is served a vector computed from different text. Callers must
/// not assume case or spacing is normalised for live embeddings.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Still not the key-free default.</b> This path needs credentials, so
/// <see cref="ConceptEmbeddingSource"/> remains what <see cref="EmbeddingSpace"/> resolves to when
