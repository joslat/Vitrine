/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why this type exists.</b> Until 2026-09-05 three constants — a dense floor, an attribution
/// floor and a pair of confidence bands — had ONE value serving TWO embedding spaces, and
/// the public retrieval calibration contract says what was owed: *"they should be derived per
/// space from one held-out slice, in one pass, rather than three times by hand"*. This is that one
/// pass's result. <see cref="IEmbeddingSource.SuggestedDenseScoreFloor"/> was already the right
/// SEAM for one of the three and carried the same value on both sides of it; the other two had no
/// seam at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>THE DERIVATION, in one paragraph.</b> The held-out slice is named first, in
/// <c>Galaxus.RecommendationAgent.Evals.Calibration.CalibrationSplit</c>: the four DEMO personas
/// are held out and the other ten authored customers are the fit slice — that direction, so that no
/// cut can have been steered by a tray anybody looks at. Each cut screens a score distribution; the
/// distribution is collected on the fit slice, in both spaces, from the shipped arithmetic. The
/// rule is EQUAL-TAIL TRANSPORT: read α, the fraction of the CONCEPT fit population the old
/// one-size constant admits, then take each space's own cut to be the smallest score its own fit
/// population produces whose admitted tail is still within α. Nothing is swept and nothing is moved
/// to make an output look right. The full record — populations, percentiles, realised rates on the
/// held-out slice — is preserved in the upstream calibration record now archived under
/// <c>docs/Vitrine-Retrieval-Deep-Dive.html</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ <b>What transport CANNOT establish, stated at the top rather than in a footnote.</b> It
/// preserves the operating point the project already shipped. It does not show that operating point
/// was ever right: α is READ from the concept space, so the concept row reproduces the old constant
/// by construction and only the real row moves. The one thing the concept row is tested on is
/// STABILITY — whether the old constant's admit rate is the same on customers the derivation never
/// saw. A second, independent rule (a chance-tail cut on the null distribution) is derived and
/// REPORTED by the same harness precisely because transport cannot answer that question, and where
/// the two rules disagree the report says so.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>A future home.</b> ADR-030 Slice 2's <c>ChanceFloor.Empirical</c> machinery is the right
/// long-term expression of the second rule — a chance floor derived from a measured null rather
/// than from a closed form. Slice 2 is behind unratified questions, so this is done by hand here
/// and the migration is named rather than assumed.
