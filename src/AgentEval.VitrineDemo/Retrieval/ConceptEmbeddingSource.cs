/// <b>This is a demo stand-in for a real embedding model.</b> It is not
/// <c>text-embedding-3-small</c> and it does not pretend to be. It exists so this sample is
/// deterministic, hermetic and runs with no API key and no network — which matters for an
/// interview demo and matters more for an evaluation, where a retrieval layer that changes
/// between runs makes every number unfalsifiable. The live path is
/// <see cref="AzureEmbeddingSource"/>; the committed-asset path is
/// <see cref="PrecomputedEmbeddingSource"/>. Both are written for real.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why not a hash embedding.</b> A signed-FNV bag-of-words vector demonstrates retrieval
/// PLUMBING and nothing else: semantically unrelated products with shared vocabulary score high,
/// and the genuine cross-category link — hiking pack to travel tripod, which shares almost no
/// vocabulary — scores near zero. Shipping that as "semantic search" would print a false tick on
/// the one claim this demo exists to make. So the offline default is not a hash. It is a small,
/// hand-authored semantic space.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>How it retrieves by meaning.</b> Every dimension is a named CONCEPT, not a hashed token
/// bucket, and many different surface words project onto the same dimension. A query about
/// <i>"shooting waterfalls on hikes"</i> lands on
/// <see cref="LandscapePhotography"/>, <see cref="LongExposureLightControl"/>,
/// <see cref="HikingTrekking"/> and <see cref="CarriedWeight"/>; a 10-stop ND filter's embedding
/// document lands on the same first two through completely different words ("neutral density",
/// "slow shutter", "context:golden-hour"). The two vectors are neighbours while sharing no
/// keyword — which is exactly the behaviour the lexical leg cannot produce, and exactly why the
/// hybrid needs both.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Honest limits, stated rather than hidden.</b> (1) Coverage is bounded by the authored
/// lexicon: vocabulary outside it contributes nothing, and <see cref="UnmappedTokens"/> exists so
/// that is inspectable rather than invisible. (2) 24 dimensions cannot express the fine
/// distinctions a 1536-dimensional model can — it separates "landscape photography at dawn" from
/// "espresso brewing", not two wide-angle zooms from each other; the lexical leg does the
/// fine-grained work. (3) The lexicon is authored against the vocabulary the design specifies for
/// this catalogue, so it is calibrated to THIS demo and would need extending for another.

        //
        // `DeadPhrasesAreDiagnosedNotJustCounted` splits the authored context phrases that embed
        // to ZERO into three buckets. The `closable` bucket is the one where the products the gold
        // rewards for that interest DO embed, so a query-side entry can reach them; the
        // `no-products` bucket is a CORPUS gap that no lexicon entry closes. These entries are the
        // closable half, and every one of them is grounded in the tags the gold is derived from —
        // not in what the phrase sounds like.
        //
        // ⚠ THREE AUTHORING RULES THIS BLOCK KEEPS, because breaking any of them would make the
        //   diagnosis move for a reason that is not the fix:
        //
        //   1. ONLY CONTENT TOKENS. "the", "a", "an", "with", "on", "and", "out", "every" and the
        //      possessive "s" appear in these phrases and are deliberately NOT added. A stop word
        //      in this lexicon would give a non-zero vector to every query containing it, which
        //      would close D-v on paper by making the measurement meaningless.
        //
        //   2. NOTHING HERE MAY TOUCH THE `no-products` BUCKET. Those six phrases turn on the
        //      tokens `weather`, `gear`, `lasts`, `morning`, `routine`, `summer`, `conditions` and
        //      `winter`. Adding any of them would stop those phrases embedding to zero and shrink
        //      the dead count WITHOUT closing anything — the corpus still carries no product for
        //      the token. That is why "training through the winter" is closed on `training` alone.
        //
        //   3. THE STEMMER IS DOING WORK AND THE SINGULAR IS THE ENTRY. `ride` covers "ride",
        //      "rides" and "riding"; `ascent` covers "ascents"; `card` covers "cards"; `session`
        //      covers "sessions"; `weigh` covers "weighing". Authoring both forms would hide a
        //      stemmer regression behind a duplicate.
        //
        // ⚠ NO EXPECTED OUTCOME IS RECORDED HERE, ON PURPOSE. An earlier item in this plan filed a
        //   figure that turned out to be three times too big, and had it been written beside the
        //   change it would have been a pre-registered result rather than a measurement.
