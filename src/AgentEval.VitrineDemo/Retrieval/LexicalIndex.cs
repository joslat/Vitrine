/// The lexical leg of the hybrid retriever (design §D.3) — an in-process, IDF-weighted token
/// overlap scorer with an exact boost for model numbers and GTINs.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why this leg is not optional.</b> Dense retrieval is at its weakest exactly where Galaxus
/// customers are strongest: they type model numbers. <c>α7 IV</c>, <c>A7IV</c> and
/// <c>ILCE-7M4</c> are three surface forms of one product, and a 1536-dimensional vector treats
/// the difference as noise. This leg treats it as the signal.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>What it stands in for.</b> In production this leg is Galaxus's existing Elasticsearch.
/// The architectural claim is <i>fuse with their search, do not replace it</i> — a stronger
/// claim than "we built a new search", and the reason the fusion step uses RRF, which needs no
/// score calibration between a cosine and a token count.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Indexed fields:</b> <see cref="Product.Name"/>, <see cref="Product.Brand"/>,
/// <see cref="Product.Specs"/> keys and values, and — since B-21 (2026-09-05) —
/// <see cref="Product.Description"/> at <see cref="DescriptionFieldWeight"/>. Use-context tags
/// are still NOT indexed here. That is not an omission: the whole demonstration is that the
/// cross-category link (hiking pack → travel tripod) lives on the <c>Use:</c> line and is
/// invisible to lexical matching. Indexing tags here would blur the one claim the demo exists to
/// make, and would make the lexical baseline look better than the thing it is a baseline for.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why <see cref="Product.Description"/> was added, and what it is FOR.</b> §D.3's original
/// field list was Name / Brand / Specs, and the omission was invisible until the dense leg went
/// away. <see cref="EmbeddingDocument"/> carries the description (line 5 of the template), so on
/// the dense path the prose is searchable; on the lexical path it was not indexed at all. The
/// consequence, MEASURED 2026-09-05: with the dense leg unavailable, Nadia's three searches
/// returned <b>0 candidates each</b> and Demo 01's offline arm fell from 6 recommendations to 0 —
/// every one of her six products had been the dense leg's alone, because nothing in a Name, a
/// Brand or a spec value answers "multi-day trips, starts before sunrise, carried". Degraded mode
/// is supposed to DEGRADE. It COLLAPSED, and the reason was this list.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So the description is indexed, and it is indexed at the LOWEST weight of any field. That is
/// not timidity: it is the longest field by an order of magnitude, so an equal per-token weight
/// would let prose volume out-vote an exact name match on sheer count. The weight is
/// <b>chosen, not measured</b>, like every other weight in this class.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The ANCHOR rule — a fragment may add score, it may not create a hit.</b>
/// <see cref="ExpandToBag"/> splits a hyphenated token into its parts on BOTH sides, so that
/// <c>16-35</c> also reaches <c>16</c> and <c>35</c>. Without a guard the parts are
/// indistinguishable from real tokens, and two unrelated compounds meet on a fragment neither
/// side ever wrote as a word. MEASURED on B-8's own query — the derived interest label
/// <i>"multi-day trips, starts before sunrise, carried"</i> against the 99-SKU catalogue — the
/// entire lexical leg was four products and every one of them was a fragment collision:
/// <c>GLX-6007</c> (a bike multi-<b>tool</b>) at rank 1 with 10.58 on the single token
/// <c>multi</c>, <c>GLX-9003</c> (a pill organiser, "four per <b>day</b>") at 6.91 on
/// <c>day</c>, and two filter sets on <c>multi</c> from "multi-coating". ALL SIX of the query's
/// own tokens had <c>df = 0</c> in the index AS IT THEN WAS — <c>multi-day</c>, <c>trips</c>,
/// <c>starts</c>, <c>before</c>, <c>sunrise</c>, <c>carried</c> — so the only things that matched
/// were the fragments <c>multi</c> (df 3) and <c>day</c> (df 1). Rank 1 in a leg is authority under RRF
/// whatever the score, so a fragment put a Cycling SKU at the top of a photographer's tray, and
/// a Health &amp; Personal Care SKU into her candidate set. That is the false positive §8.1
/// records as B-8 and attributes to the <c>Use:</c> line, which is not where it came from — the
/// bike multi-tool's dense rank on that query was 16th of 99.
/// The same collision put a mudguard at lexical rank 1 for <i>"Mirrorless full-frame"</i>:
/// <c>mirrorless</c> has df 0 and <c>full-frame</c> df 1 (Nadia's own camera), while the
/// fragments <c>full</c> (df 4, "full-length mudguard") and <c>frame</c> (df 3, "aluminium
/// frame") have carriers in three departments.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So a product enters the lexical result only when it is ANCHORED: it shares at least one
/// token that NEITHER side had to split to produce, or it took a model-number or GTIN boost.
/// Fragment overlap still contributes its IDF-weighted score to an anchored product — the
/// <c>16</c> of <c>16-35</c> is not thrown away — it simply cannot, alone, admit a product.
/// This is the same defect class as <see cref="StopWords"/> (a token with no discriminating
/// meaning winning on <c>df = 1</c>) and it is fixed in the same place, at match time.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ <b>Those df figures are pre-B-21 and are left standing as the RECORD OF THE DEFECT, not as a
/// description of this index.</b> Indexing <see cref="Product.Description"/> moved every one of

/// <c>sunrise</c> 0 → 1, <c>before</c> 0 → 4, <c>carried</c> 0 → 6, <c>mirrorless</c> 0 → 2;
/// <c>trips</c> is the one that stayed at 0. The fragments moved too — <c>multi</c> 3 → 6,
/// <c>day</c> 1 → 7, <c>full</c> 4 → 6, <c>frame</c> 3 → 5 — which DAMPS them: a fragment with
/// six carriers earns far less IDF than one with three, so the collision this rule was written
/// against is weaker as well as blocked.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The anchor rule stays.</b> It is not made redundant by a bigger vocabulary — a fragment can

/// ADMISSION, the description decides whether there is anything to admit. What changed is the
