/// Demo 02 — the interest-map discovery loop: five executors, five named routes, one conditional
/// loop-back edge, bounded at three rounds.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>What this demo is arguing, narrowly.</b> A single agent with a search tool can call it
/// twice. What it cannot do is write its second query against documents it has not retrieved
/// yet. So the loop does not add a CAPABILITY; it adds an OBLIGATION (a per-interest coverage
/// ledger) and an AUDIT TRAIL (a printed gap list and a stated stop reason). Whether the single
/// agent would have done it anyway is an empirical question — measure it, do not assert it, and
/// the public retrieval deep dive records what this repository's corpus
/// can and cannot currently support on that question.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>What to watch, in order.</b> The DIRECT/LATENT split in the interest map; the products each
/// query discovers, named rather than counted; the deterministic pre-gate rejecting before a token
/// is spent; the coverage ledger, which is the artifact a human verifies; the loop-back arrow with
/// its round number; round 2's queries speaking the CATALOGUE's vocabulary instead of the
/// customer's; the SAME guardrail pipeline Demo 1 runs, with its ledger; and the structural query-vocabulary control
/// panel, which prints whether or not it fired.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The answer is screened by exactly Demo 1's bar.</b> <c>DiscoveryPresentation.Render</c> hands
/// the loop's selection to the shipped <c>GuardrailPipeline</c> and prints it with the shipped
/// <c>RecommendationPrinter</c>, so the comparison the whole demo rests on is not confounded by two
/// renderers and two guardrail suites. The guardrail ledger you see below the recommendations is
