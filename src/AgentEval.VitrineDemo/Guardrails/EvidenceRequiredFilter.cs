/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Note the shape of this check.</b> The artifact under test does not get to supply the bar
/// it is measured against. The interest label must be one the CODE derived; the purchase ids
/// must be ones the customer actually has; the attribute key and value must be the catalogue's
/// own. A model that invents a flattering spec value fails the check <i>harder</i>, not softer —
/// which is the opposite of what happens when a grader scores plausibility.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The one principled exception, and why it is not a loophole.</b> §F.3 as written requires
/// <c>UserPurchaseIds</c> to be non-empty. That is right for a behaviour-derived interest and
/// wrong for a stated one: under the personalization opt-out (§F.6) there IS no history — the
/// tool refuses it — so a recommendation serving a need the customer just typed has no purchase
/// id it could honestly cite. Requiring one would either kill the opt-out path or teach the
/// model to fabricate ids. So the rule is inverted per signal kind: a
/// <see cref="InterestEvidenceKinds.StatedInSession"/> signal must cite NO purchase ids, and any
/// other kind must cite at least one. Both directions are enforced, so neither is a way through.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A cited purchase that the classifier ruled a GIFT is rejected separately from a purchase
/// belonging to someone else: both are wrong, but "you bought a games console" as evidence for
/// Marco's own interests is a specific, nameable failure and deserves its own reason token.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Three grades of wrong id, three reason tokens (§8.1 B-5).</b> A cited purchase can fail for
/// three different reasons and they are NOT the same failure: it can belong to somebody else
/// (<see cref="GuardrailReasons.ForeignPurchaseId"/>), it can be the customer's own but a gift
/// (<see cref="GuardrailReasons.GiftPurchaseCited"/>), or it can be the customer's own, not a
/// gift, and simply not evidence for the interest being cited
/// (<see cref="GuardrailReasons.PurchaseDoesNotEvidenceSignal"/>). The third was invisible until
