/// <b>Why two layers, and why this is the design's own correction of itself (§0.5 / D-6).</b>
/// The first draft blocked purchases in blocklisted CATEGORIES and cited Target's pregnancy
/// inference as the motivating case. But Target's inference came from unscented lotion,
/// cotton balls, magnesium supplements and a large handbag — <b>none of which sits in a
/// sensitive category</b>. A source-category filter blocks the channel a naive system uses
/// and leaves open the one the regulator cares about. Worse, this repository's own
/// interest-map builder is <i>specifically engineered</i> to find exactly that kind of
/// cross-category conjunction (§B.2), so the control was pointed away from the mechanism most
/// likely to breach it.
/// </para>
/// <para>The two layers, both implemented here:</para>
/// <list type="number">
///   <item>
///     <b>Inbound (source).</b> <c>InterestMapBuilder</c> calls
///     <see cref="IsBlockedLabel(string, out string)"/> on every candidate interest label
///     BEFORE it is emitted, and never emits a signal from a category flagged
///     <see cref="Category.SensitiveInference"/>. A blocked label is reported, not silently
///     swallowed.
///   </item>
///   <item>
///     <b>Outbound (output).</b> <see cref="Apply"/> screens every emitted interest label and
///     every customer-facing reason string against <see cref="SpecialCategoryTerms"/>, and
///     drops the WHOLE recommendation on a hit. This is the layer that can catch a
///     conjunction assembled from individually innocuous purchases, because it looks at what
///     the system SAID rather than at where the evidence came from.
///   </item>
/// </list>
/// <para>
/// <b>Suppression is about UNSOLICITED inference, not about refusing to serve.</b>
/// "Pregnancy &amp; Baby" stays browsable and searchable; a customer who asks for a larger
/// blood-pressure cuff gets one. The exemption is explicit and narrow: a term the CUSTOMER
/// raised in this session (<see cref="GuardrailContext.SensitiveTopicsStatedInSession"/>) or a
