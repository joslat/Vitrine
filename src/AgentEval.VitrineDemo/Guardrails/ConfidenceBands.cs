/// which keeps weak items out of the primary tray — not a probability. The calibration story
/// (a reliability curve of stated confidence against gold-set correctness) belongs to the eval
/// lane and has not been run. Claiming calibration you have not measured is exactly the failure
/// this design is trying to avoid, so the numbers are stated as what they are: two constants
/// somebody chose.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A confidence that is NaN, infinite, negative or above 1 is not a low confidence — it is not
/// a confidence at all, and it is dropped under its own reason

/// Coercing a malformed number into a passing one is how a broken instrument reads clean.

/// Banding runs over BOTH incoming trays and re-routes across them: an item the model put in
