/// <b>Why this type exists at all.</b> Until this argument was added the tool carried only the
/// PRODUCT side, and Demo 1 DERIVED the user side from retrieval provenance — from which search
/// need happened to surface the SKU. That derivation is honest but it makes the user-side arm of
/// <see cref="EvidenceRequiredFilter"/> a tautology: the label and the purchase ids both come out
/// of the same <see cref="Domain.InterestSignal"/>, so the comparison is <c>x ⊆ x</c> and the arm
/// reports <c>arm_inapplicable</c> on every single turn. An arm that cannot fire has a chance
/// floor of 1.0.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The wire format is deliberately dumb.</b> <c>label | PUR-AA-01,PUR-AA-02</c> — one pipe,
/// then a comma list. A pipe rather than a comma separates them because an interest label is a
/// natural-language sentence and may well contain commas; a pipe never appears in an authored
/// label. Parsing is lenient (a missing pipe means "no purchase ids", which is the correct shape
/// for a stated-in-session need) and VERIFICATION is strict: an invented label fails
/// <see cref="GuardrailReasons.UnknownSignalLabel"/>, a foreign id fails
/// <see cref="GuardrailReasons.ForeignPurchaseId"/>, and one of the customer's OWN ids that does
/// not evidence the cited signal fails
/// <see cref="GuardrailReasons.PurchaseDoesNotEvidenceSignal"/>. Leniency in the parser costs
/// nothing because none of it can flatter the artifact under test.

/// ⚠ The argument is OPTIONAL, and that is a decision rather than an oversight. Making it
/// required would drop every recommendation on any turn where the model omitted it — an extreme
/// value produced by a wiring fault rather than by the thing under test, and the exact failure
/// shape this project keeps a rule about. When it is absent, Demo 1 falls back to the derived
/// user side AND writes the <c>arm_inapplicable</c> note, so the ledger always says which of the
/// two paths produced the numbers on screen.
