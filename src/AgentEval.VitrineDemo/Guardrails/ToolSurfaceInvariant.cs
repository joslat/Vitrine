/// <b>Thirteen, and why the count is written down three times.</b> Three semantic tools, nine

/// TEN-name registration against a NINE-name allow-list and would have thrown on its first run
/// (the tool-surface consistency rule). The fix is not to be more careful: the counts are constants, the lists are
/// built from the same constants, and a static constructor refuses to load the type if they
/// disagree. Drift becomes a load failure instead of a first-run surprise.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Zero of the thirteen mutate anything.</b> No <c>AddToCart</c>, no <c>PlaceOrder</c>, no
/// <c>SaveProfile</c>, no <c>ApplyVoucher</c>. This is not a prompt instruction the model can be
/// argued out of — it is the absence of a capability. Adding a write tool later cannot be done
/// accidentally, because the app stops starting.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The paradox, and the two factories that resolve it.</b> An agent that has no
/// <c>PlaceOrder</c> makes <c>NeverCallTool("PlaceOrder")</c> a check with a chance floor of
/// 1.0 — it proves nothing, because the prohibition was never tempting. So there are two
/// configurations, and two assertions:

///     by the two eval cases that exercise the human-confirmation gate. The thirteen names plus
