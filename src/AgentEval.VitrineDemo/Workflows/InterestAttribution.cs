/// <para>
/// Attribution and retrieval rank answer different questions. A fused score says a product ranked
/// well for a query; it does not prove that the product carries anything the interest names. A

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The public retrieval calibration derives dense floors per space. The real-vectors floor is
/// 0.223 rather than the transported 0.280. On Luca Ferrari (<c>USR-LF-04</c>) — one purchase,
/// zero independent signals, and the
/// contentless utterance <i>"Hi — what do you recommend for me?"</i> — that turned 0 candidates and
/// <c>GAPS_UNRESOLVABLE</c> into 2 candidates, a second discovery round and five recommendations,
/// two of them espresso accessories credited to an <i>"Over-ear wireless"</i> interest.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The threshold is not an attribution control and must not be moved for this case.</b> It is
/// derived on a named held-out
/// split; re-tuning it so one persona comes out right would be fitting a calibrated number to a
/// result. This predicate instead asks whether the product carries anything the interest names.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Every input is corpus fact or the interest's own declaration.</b> The product side is the

/// <see cref="Interest.AttributeHints"/>, <see cref="Interest.CategoryHints"/>,
/// <see cref="Interest.QueryTerms"/> and <see cref="Interest.Label"/>. Nothing here reads a
/// retrieval score, and neither side is supplied by the retriever whose output is being screened.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>It is deliberately lenient in the accepting direction.</b> Any one of the three signals is
/// enough, the product's title, brand, category path and attribute tokens are all folded into one
/// haystack, and the word test accepts a prefix relation in either direction — so "espresso"
/// reaches the "espresso" token of "espresso machine descaler" and "Headlamps" reaches "Headlamp".
/// It is NOT a substring test: see <see cref="WordsMeet"/>, where "over" deliberately fails to meet
/// "cover". The failure this guards against is a product with NO connection at all being counted as
