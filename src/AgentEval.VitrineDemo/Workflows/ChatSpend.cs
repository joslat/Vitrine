/// <b>Why this exists, and what was actually broken.</b> <c>DiscoveryModelCall.RunAsync</c> called
/// <c>AIAgent.RunAsync</c> and returned <c>response.Text</c>, discarding
/// <c>Microsoft.Agents.AI.AgentResponse.Usage</c> — the property the provider fills in on exactly
/// that call. The usage was never missing from the response and was never un-asked-for; it reached
/// this process and our code dropped it. The proof is a same-provider comparison inside this
/// repository: <c>MAFAgentAdapter</c> makes the identical <c>RunAsync</c> call and reads
/// <c>response.Usage</c> (<c>src/AgentEval.MAF/MAF/MAFAgentAdapter.cs</c>), and the evals that run
/// through it report <c>measured usage N · token-estimated 0 · unaccounted 0</c> against the same
/// deployment. So <c>agent -- 2</c> made three live model calls and printed no token count, and
/// Eval 08's workflow arm fell back to the harness's text-length estimate over text that is
/// REPLAYED from workflow state — an estimate of the wrong string, of the wrong tokenizer.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The one rule this type is built around: an ABSENCE is not a ZERO.</b> A call whose response
/// carried no usage block contributes nothing to the token totals and increments
/// <see cref="CallsWithoutUsage"/> instead, and <see cref="Describe"/> renders the two cases in
/// different words. A run of three calls that all reported <c>0</c> tokens and a run of three calls
/// that reported nothing at all must never print the same line — the first is a measurement, the
/// second is an unknown.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// ⚠ <b>And the same rule one level down, which the first version of this type broke.</b> The check
/// above was applied to the whole block and then each half was read as <c>?? 0</c>, so a response
/// carrying a prompt count and NO completion count was recorded as <c>1,234 prompt + 0 completion</c>
/// and reported <see cref="Complete"/>. A half-populated block is now a
/// <see cref="CallsWithPartialUsage"/>: the reported half is summed because the provider did report
/// it, the missing half adds nothing, the total is labelled a LOWER BOUND, and the meter no longer
/// calls itself complete — so <c>Eval08LiveWorkflowArm</c> cannot publish it as measured.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>It never estimates, and it never sees our own text.</b> There is no path in this type from a
/// string to a token count. That is deliberate: a meter that counts our own tokens is measuring our
/// tokenizer, not the provider's bill. If a later change wants a fallback, it belongs somewhere
/// that is not called a measurement.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>No currency here, on purpose.</b> This project has no AgentEval dependency (see the csproj)
/// and therefore no rate table, so it cannot turn tokens into money without inventing a rate.
/// Consumers that DO have a declared rate source apply it themselves and name it; the one that does
/// not says the money is UNKNOWN. Tokens are the measurement either way.
