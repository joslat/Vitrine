/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Three counters, kept apart — and the reason they used to be one.</b> The first version of

/// <c>Used</c> was the list's length. So the four <c>PresentRecommendation</c> calls of an
/// answer counted against the same cap as the searches, and the 2026-09-04 live run printed
/// "24 of 24 — the model stopped on its own". It had not stopped on its own: 20 refusable calls
/// plus 4 presentations had saturated a counter that was measuring two different things, which
/// is the n/n extreme this repository's rules flag as a wiring fault. The counters are now:
/// </para>

///   <item><description><see cref="Used"/> / <see cref="Cap"/> — REFUSABLE calls: the three
///   semantic and seven structured tools. Past the cap they return
///   <see cref="ToolJson.BudgetExhausted"/>. Default <see cref="DefaultMaxCalls"/>, unchanged
///   from the first version so the agent may do exactly what it could do before.</description></item>

/// <b>The memo.</b> C-09 of the 2026-09-04 live run issued four byte-identical
/// <c>SearchProductsByMeaning</c> calls and then four more, burning 12 of 24 refusable slots on
/// about three distinct queries — and roughly half of a 148-second turn. Within one scope an
/// identical (tool, arguments) call is now answered from the memo with
/// <see cref="ToolJson.AlreadyReturned"/> and consumes nothing. Nothing the agent MAY do has
/// changed: the same arguments produce the same answer within a turn, because the catalogue does
